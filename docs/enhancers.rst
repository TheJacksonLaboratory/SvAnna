Enhancers
=========

SvAnna includes computational Enhancers models that comprise the chromosomal location of an enhancer, its
tissue specificity, together with a `human phenotype ontology <https://hpo.jax.org/app/>`_ term that represents
the assumed most likely phenotypic consequence of disruption of the Enhancer.

The Enhancer definitions are part of the SvAnna release and end-users do not need to run the Enhancer extraction code.
We provide the code as well as the documentation in this section to document our methods and to provide a starting
point for those who would like to extend the method.
