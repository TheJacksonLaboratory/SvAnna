Structural variation
####################

Structural variation (SV) is generally defined as a region of DNA approximately 1 kb and larger in size
(`Freeman et al., 2006 <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16809666/>`_). SV includes
inversions and balanced translocations or genomic imbalances (insertions and deletions),
often referred to as copy number variants (CNVs).

svanna is intended to be used to annotate and interpret VCF files representing the results of
long-read genome sequencing using approaches for calling SVs. Currently, svanna supports the
following types of SV.
