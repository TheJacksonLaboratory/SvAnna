Deletions
=========


A deletion is a type of DNA variant that involves the loss of genetic material. If the loss is over 1 kb, then
the deletion is refered to as a structural variant (Note that svanna prioritizes any deletion that is included
in the input VCF file, even those that are shorter than 1kb). Deletions may also be refered to as a type
of copy number variant (CNV) with copy loss.
