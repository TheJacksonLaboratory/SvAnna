  #dataParameters:
    # TAD must be present in at least 90% of the tissues to be included in the analysis
    #tadStabilityThreshold: 90
    #enhancers:
      # Include VISTA developmental enhancers in the analysis
      #useVista: True
      # Include FANTOM5 enhancers in the analysis
      #useFantom5: False
      # FANTOM5 enhancer must have at least 50% specificity to a tissue
      #fantom5TissueSpecificity: 0.5
  #prioritizationParameters:
    # term similarity measure, choose from {RESNIK_SYMMETRIC, RESNIK_ASYMMETRIC}
    #termSimilarityMeasure: RESNIK_SYMMETRIC
    # The mode for getting information content of the most informative common ancestors for terms t1, and t2.
    # Choose from {IN_MEMORY, DATABASE}.
    # IN_MEMORY is faster but uses more memory
    # DATABASE is slower but also more memory efficient
    #icMicaMode: DATABASE
    # An event involving max N genes to be considered by the prototype prioritizer

    # Scaling factor to use for calculating fitness of a gene with or without a variant
    #geneFactor: 1.
    # Scaling factor to use for calculating fitness of an enhancer with or without a variant
    #enhancerFactor: .25
    # Number of bases prepended to a transcript and evaluated as a promoter region
    #promoterLength: 2000
    # Set to 0. to score promoter variants as strictly as coding variants, or to 1. to skip
